# PC Flipper Windows Script
I made this script to make it easier for PC flippers to prepare Windows on builds being prepared for sale.  
Even if you're not a PC flipper you can still use it for your own computer to install drivers, install apps, and more!


# Execution

1. Type "PowerShell" into the Start Menu.
2. Find the result that says "Windows PowerShell" (or PowerShell 7 if you have it), right-click it, and select "Run as administrator". 
3. Paste in the following oneliner command: `irm bit.ly/pcflipperwindowsscript | iex`

This will run the script. Prerequisites may need to be installed at the beginning of script execution, so please be patient while you wait for the script to start. 


# What it does:

This script makes Windows setup easier by automating annoying tasks like installing apps and drivers.  
Examples of what it can do:
- Detect your GPU and install the correct graphics drivers for your system
- Identify your motherboard and CPU to install the appropriate chipset drivers
- Open your motherboard's support page for downloading additional drivers
- Install popular apps (like Firefox, Chrome, Steam, 7-Zip, VLC Media Player, and many more)
- Debloat Windows (remove telemetry, enable useful features, etc)
- Activate Windows if not already activated
- Run an optional FurMark stress test to verify GPU stability

Every feature is optional, and you can use the simple "Main Menu" to select exactly what you want to do with checkboxes.
