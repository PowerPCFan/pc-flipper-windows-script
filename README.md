# pc-flipper-windows-script
I made this script to make it easier for PC flippers to prepare Windows on builds being prepared for sale.

# What it does:
- Detects graphics card and installs the appropriate graphics drivers
- Detects motherboard and installs chipset drivers
- Allows you to choose what extras to install from a variety of apps
- If you chose to install FurMark it will run a stress test

# Execution
1. Type "Windows PowerShell" into the Start Menu.\
2. Right-click it, and select "Run as administrator."\
3. Paste in the following command: `irm bit.ly/pcflipperwindowsscript | iex`\

# Issues
If you have any issues, please create an "issue" on the [Issues page](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/issues).\
You can also **suggest new ideas to add to the script** using the Issues page even though that's not it's intended use. 

# Contributing
If you want to contribute, please fork the repo, clone it, edit/modify it to your liking, and make a [pull request](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/pulls) where I can review the code and choose to add it to the main script or not. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.
