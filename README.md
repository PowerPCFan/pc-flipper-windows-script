# PC Flipper Windows Script
I made this script to make it easier for PC flippers to prepare Windows on builds being prepared for sale.  
Even if you're not a PC flipper you can still use it for your own computer to install drivers, install apps, and more!


# Execution

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/releases/latest) page.
2. From the latest release, download the file called `pc-flipper-windows-script.exe`. 
3. Double-click the file to run it, and accept the prompt to run as administrator. That's all!


# What it does:

This script makes Windows setup easier by automating annoying tasks like installing apps and drivers.  
Examples of what it can do:
- Detect your GPU and install the correct graphics drivers for your system
- Identify your motherboard and CPU to install the appropriate chipset drivers
- Open your motherboard's support page for downloading additional drivers
- Install popular apps (like Firefox, Chrome, Steam, 7-Zip, VLC Media Player, and many more)
- Debloat Windows (remove telemetry, enable useful features, etc)
- Activate Windows if not already activated
- Run an optional FurMark stress test to verify GPU stability

Every feature is optional, and you can use the simple and user friendly "Script Options" window that shows on startup to select exactly what you want to do.
