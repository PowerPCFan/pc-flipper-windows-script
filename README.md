# pc-flipper-windows-script
I made this script to make it easier for PC flippers to prepare Windows on builds being prepared for sale.

# What it does:
- Detects graphics card and downloads the appropriate drivers
- Detects motherboard and searches for chipset drivers
- Installs Firefox
- Installs FurMark and runs a system stress test
- Opens Sysprep

# Execution
You can run the script using the command `irm bit.ly/pcflipperwindowsscript | iex`. 

# Issues
If you have any issues, please make an issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/issues). 

# Known Issues
The testing-unstable branch is currently 100% broken. I am working on fixing it (and when it is fixed I will push it to the main branch) but for now please use the main branch because it will remain working 100% of the time. 

# Contributing
If you want to contribute please follow the normal procedure for doing this - fork the repo, clone it, edit/modify it to your liking, and make a [pull request](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/pulls) where I can review the code and choose to add it to the main script or not.
