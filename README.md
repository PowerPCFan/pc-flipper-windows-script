# pc-flipper-windows-script
I made this script to make it easier for PC flippers to prepare Windows on builds being prepared for sale.

# What it does:
- Detects graphics card and installs the appropriate graphics drivers
- Detects motherboard and installs chipset drivers
- Allows you to choose what extras to install from a variety of apps
- Installs FurMark and runs a stress test

# Execution
Recommended: You can run the script using the quick run command `irm bit.ly/pcflipperwindowsscript | iex`. \
Alternatively you can download the "run.ps1" file and open it in PowerShell. **Not recommended for novice users**

# Issues
If you have any issues, please create an "issue" on the [Issues page](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/issues).\
You can also **suggest new ideas to add to the script** using the Issues page even though that's not it's intended use. 

# Branches
- Main - **you should always use this branch, since it will always be working**
- Legacy - I would not recommend using this, it's an ancient version that lacks bug fixes, updates, and support - but it seems to be stable and bug-free
Ignore the testing branch.

# Contributing
If you want to contribute, please fork the repo, clone it, edit/modify it to your liking, and make a [pull request](https://github.com/PowerPCFan/pc-flipper-windows-script/pulls) where I can review the code and choose to add it to the main script or not. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.
